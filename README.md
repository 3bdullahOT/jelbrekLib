# jelbrekLib
Give me tfp0, I give you jelbrek

Library with commonly used patches in open-source jailbreaks. Call this a (light?) QiLin open-source alternative.
h
# Compiling:

    ./make.sh
    
# Setup

- Compile OR head over to https://github.com/jakeajames/jelbrekLib/tree/master/downloads and get everything there. 
- Link with jelbrekLib.a & IOKit.tbd and include jelbrekLib.h
- Call init_jelbrek() with tfp0 as your first thing and term_jelbrek() as your last

# Issues

- Not everything tested, but stuff should work
- AMFID patch won't resist after app enters background. Fix would be using a daemon (like amfidebilitate; well one is coming soon, open-source ;D) or injecting a dylib
